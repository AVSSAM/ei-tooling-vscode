## Purpose
> The purpose of the following change would be to provide a clear indication in relation to the naming conventions associated to the creation of a WSO2 ESB project
> Add missing onCommand extensions as some of the services are not available per default.
> Refactored some naming conventions as they were too abstract.

## Goals
> This specific feature would provide the user/developer with the ability to clearly define and name the artifactId as well as the ability to provide a groupId associated to the WSO2 ESB project.
